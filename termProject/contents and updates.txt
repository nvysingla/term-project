Changes made to the project: (Deliverable-2 2/12/2015)

1. Developed partial user interface and implemented using classes in UIversion2.py
2. Developed partial working algorithm to obtain the bounding boxes per character in each image, 
	and compare to a given set of test images in compare3.py
3. From the previous submission, the function that uses a module to OCR has been added to UI.py
4.The function to convert text to speech also added in UIversion2.py

List of Items in the deliverable submission:

######## MAIN FILES ##########

UIversion2.py
compare3.py

######### EXTRAS ##############

testimages folder : contains some of the images used to test the algorithm
compare folder : contains the image set that is used for comparison
Added Note: While submitting, I had to remove the two image folders for the file to be less than 10MB.
timesheet.xlsx : a log of the time spent working on the project


NOTE: the program will not work until the test images and the directory containing letter and number are in the same directory as the .py file.
